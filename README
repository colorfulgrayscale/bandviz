bandViz is a python script. When you give it a wikipedia link of your favorite music
band or musician, it builds you a slick graph.

You will need to pass the name of the band/artist and the resolution needed as arguments.
The script will crawl through wikipedia, parse the relevant information and build a 
graphViz file.
